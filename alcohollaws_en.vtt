1
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:11.481
Welcome to Leadership Essentials.

2
00:00:11.627 --> 00:00:15.251
Online learning for youth
development professionals.

3
00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:19.829
Alcohol beverage laws.

4
00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.071
Think before you drink.

5
00:00:22.717 --> 00:00:25.024
This module will focus on the laws

6
00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.347
related to alcoholic beverages.

7
00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:29.333
We come into contact with these beverages

8
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.990
in our everyday life.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.695
Whether that be beer or wine or liquor.

10
00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:37.031
In the United States and in most countries

11
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:38.237
around the world,

12
00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:41.286
there are laws regulating the purchase,

13
00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:43.115
the possession and the consumption

14
00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:44.386
of these beverages.

15
00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:47.628
These laws exist because
of the intoxicating effect

16
00:00:47.628 --> 00:00:49.727
of alcoholic beverages.

17
00:00:49.976 --> 00:00:53.583
Consumption can impair you
mentally or physically.

18
00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:56.277
That impairment can cause
you to injure yourself

19
00:00:56.277 --> 00:00:57.385
or others.

20
00:00:57.385 --> 00:00:59.591
Why do you need to know about these laws?

21
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:01.361
If you're going to work into summer camp

22
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.383
or summer camp program,

23
00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:05.162
there are three essential reasons.

24
00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:07.780
First, inappropriate use of alcohol

25
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.528
can affect your job.

26
00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:10.580
Here's how.

27
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.197
As you know from the module series

28
00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.468
on Duty of Care.

29
00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:14.739
You have the duty to care for the

30
00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:17.102
safety of the children
enrolled in your program.

31
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.682
You can't carry out that duty

32
00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:20.888
if your judgement is impaired by alcohol.

33
00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:22.728
You're a role model to the children

34
00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:24.461
with whom you will be working.

35
00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:27.394
Your job is to model appropriate behavior,

36
00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:30.352
breaking the law or working while hungover

37
00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:34.432
or intoxicated would be
extremely poor role modeling.

38
00:01:34.432 --> 00:01:37.196
Even during your time off away from camp,

39
00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:39.772
you are likely to known
by the camp or program

40
00:01:39.772 --> 00:01:41.084
for which you work.

41
00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:43.391
Their reputation is
affected by your behavior

42
00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:45.088
in the use of alcohol.

43
00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:48.797
Second, the use of alcohol
in violation of the law

44
00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:51.405
can lead to criminal or civil liability.

45
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.838
That puts in jeopardy your job at camp,

46
00:01:53.838 --> 00:01:55.109
and in the future.

47
00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.701
It also could harm the camp's reputation.

48
00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:01.613
Third, you may reside in
a different jurisdiction

49
00:02:01.613 --> 00:02:04.591
from where you are going
to work in a summer camp

50
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.938
or program.

51
00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.957
It's the laws and the jurisdiction

52
00:02:07.957 --> 00:02:09.492
where you're going to work

53
00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:13.145
control the purchase and
use of alcoholic beverages.

54
00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:14.075
You need to make sure

55
00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:16.039
you know what those laws are.

56
00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.143
Here's a general description of the laws

57
00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:20.166
related to alcoholic beverages.

58
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.717
But remember, when you get to your camp

59
00:02:22.717 --> 00:02:24.008
or summer program,

60
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:25.523
you need to make sure that you know

61
00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:27.968
what the specific laws are there.

62
00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:31.347
I've asked some staff
members to put on a skit,

63
00:02:31.347 --> 00:02:34.382
showing acts related to
alcohol which are illegal.

64
00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.551
Watch the skit and see
whether you can identify

65
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:39.016
three violations related to age.

66
00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:42.242
Can you also identify other
alcohol law violations

67
00:02:42.242 --> 00:02:44.068
not related to age?

68
00:02:45.588 --> 00:02:47.037
We need more beer.

69
00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:49.055
What are you going to do about it?

70
00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:50.317
You're not old enough.

71
00:02:50.317 --> 00:02:51.487
No, no, no, I know a place

72
00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:52.335
they don't check ID,

73
00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:54.415
I've been there before
and I've gotten beer.

74
00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:55.381
That sounds awesome.

75
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:56.185
Can I come too?

76
00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:56.736
I just...

77
00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:58.027
Can I borrow your ID--

78
00:02:58.027 --> 00:03:00.009
Sure, I guess we look enough like.

79
00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:01.312
Thanks man.

80
00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:02.583
Hey, I'll drive.

81
00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:03.529
I'm 21.

82
00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.262
Let me finish this first.

83
00:03:06.782 --> 00:03:10.003
(celebrating)

84
00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:12.913
Age restrictions are a common element

85
00:03:12.913 --> 00:03:14.597
of alcohol laws.

86
00:03:14.597 --> 00:03:16.173
In the United States,

87
00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:20.101
the line between legal
and illegal is 21 years.

88
00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:23.550
In countries other than the United States

89
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.036
that age may range from 16 through 21.

90
00:03:27.036 --> 00:03:28.916
You must be of age

91
00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:31.361
at least 21 in the U.S.

92
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.430
to purchase, to possess,

93
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.910
or to consume alcoholic beverages.

94
00:03:37.158 --> 00:03:38.856
Each is a separate offense.

95
00:03:38.856 --> 00:03:40.960
Purchasing and consumption are obvious.

96
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.328
But remember if these two acts are illegal

97
00:03:43.328 --> 00:03:45.107
then mere possession of alcohol

98
00:03:45.107 --> 00:03:47.206
is likely to be illegal as well.

99
00:03:47.582 --> 00:03:49.179
Did you get all three?

100
00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:52.397
There are other laws
that relate to alcohol

101
00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:54.155
without regard to age.

102
00:03:54.155 --> 00:03:56.599
These laws include the following.

103
00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.765
It's illegal in the United States

104
00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:04.036
to provide, to possess,
or to use a fraudulent ID

105
00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:06.120
to purchase alcoholic beverages.

106
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.600
In the skit you saw,

107
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.059
all three of these
offenses were committed.

108
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:13.317
Every jurisdiction
regulates alcohol by age.

109
00:04:13.317 --> 00:04:15.356
It's likely they have similar laws.

110
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:17.852
In the United States and
many other jurisdiction,

111
00:04:17.852 --> 00:04:20.572
it's a violation to
consume alcoholic beverages

112
00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.812
or to have an open container of alcohol

113
00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:24.342
in a moving vehicle.

114
00:04:24.693 --> 00:04:27.812
Any container is open
if its seal is broken.

115
00:04:27.812 --> 00:04:29.998
Even if the lid has been refastened.

116
00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:31.472
Also it maybe against the law

117
00:04:31.472 --> 00:04:33.459
to consume alcoholic beverages

118
00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:36.000
or have an open container
in a public place,

119
00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:39.490
such as a street sidewalk, park or beach.

120
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.357
Breaking these laws can result in a fine,

121
00:04:42.357 --> 00:04:44.284
even going to jail.

122
00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.922
And remember, these laws can be violated

123
00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:48.830
without intoxication.

124
00:04:48.846 --> 00:04:52.616
Let's turn now to laws
related to intoxication.

125
00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:54.517
In every state in the United States,

126
00:04:54.517 --> 00:04:56.600
in every province, in Canada,

127
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.135
and in most other countries,

128
00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:00.332
there are laws that prohibit the operation

129
00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:03.173
of a motor vehicle while intoxicated.

130
00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:05.323
In some jurisdiction this is called

131
00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:08.321
operating under the influence or OUI.

132
00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:11.827
In others it's called
driving while intoxicated,

133
00:05:11.827 --> 00:05:13.231
or DWI.

134
00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:15.782
In most jurisdiction with these laws,

135
00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.649
motor vehicles include automobiles

136
00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:20.449
and other vehicles that normally

137
00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.268
operate on the roadway, boats,

138
00:05:22.268 --> 00:05:23.722
or off-road vehicles,

139
00:05:23.722 --> 00:05:26.192
including ATV's or snowmobiles

140
00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:27.910
may also be included.

141
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.400
And in some jurisdictions
in the United States,

142
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.565
even non-motorized vehicles

143
00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.709
such as bicycles are included.

144
00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:38.332
Intoxication maybe proved
by one of two methods.

145
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.376
One, determination of
the amount of alcohol

146
00:05:41.376 --> 00:05:43.297
in the body by measuring the amount

147
00:05:43.297 --> 00:05:44.933
in your blood or breath.

148
00:05:44.933 --> 00:05:46.831
In the United States,

149
00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:50.254
one is intoxicated in violation of the law

150
00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:53.898
if the percent of alcohol
in that person's blood

151
00:05:53.898 --> 00:05:57.079
is at or above .08.

152
00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:59.426
So how many drinks do
you think you can have

153
00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:03.786
before your blood level is .08% or higher?

154
00:06:03.786 --> 00:06:05.747
That depends on a number of factors

155
00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:09.178
including your gender, your body mass,

156
00:06:09.314 --> 00:06:11.251
the amount of food in your stomach,

157
00:06:11.378 --> 00:06:13.066
the amount of time drinking,

158
00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:15.491
and the time since your last drink.

159
00:06:15.538 --> 00:06:17.764
The safe rule is that blood alcohol levels

160
00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:19.929
will not exceed the legal limit.

161
00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:22.785
If you do not consume more
than one drink per hour,

162
00:06:22.785 --> 00:06:26.088
but consider this about the .08% threshold

163
00:06:26.088 --> 00:06:27.882
in the United States.

164
00:06:28.183 --> 00:06:30.800
In Australia, and New Zealand,

165
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.980
and some European countries

166
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.729
intoxication is demonstrated
with a blood alcohol level

167
00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.377
of only .05%.

168
00:06:39.463 --> 00:06:41.994
It's not because it's easier to get drunk

169
00:06:41.994 --> 00:06:43.445
in those countries,

170
00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:46.283
it's because impairment
begins from the first moment

171
00:06:46.283 --> 00:06:48.037
that you begin to drink.

172
00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:51.010
That impairment diminishes your ability

173
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.125
to operate a car or care for children.

174
00:06:54.507 --> 00:06:57.871
Intoxication can also be
proven by the testimony

175
00:06:57.871 --> 00:07:00.117
of a police officer who stops you.

176
00:07:00.117 --> 00:07:02.099
The following testimony is sufficient

177
00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:04.589
to lead to a conviction of OUI.

178
00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:06.815
Observation of the operation of your car

179
00:07:06.815 --> 00:07:09.549
in a manner inconsistent
with normal operation,

180
00:07:09.549 --> 00:07:13.949
weaving, drifting, too fast or too slow

181
00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:15.504
or erratic operation.

182
00:07:15.504 --> 00:07:17.893
Observation of blood shut eyes,

183
00:07:17.893 --> 00:07:20.951
or unusually sized pupils.

184
00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:23.238
The smell of alcohol in your breath.

185
00:07:23.238 --> 00:07:26.886
Slurred speech, impaired reasoning

186
00:07:26.886 --> 00:07:29.900
or poor physical coordination.

187
00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:31.796
Listen, based on my observations,

188
00:07:31.796 --> 00:07:33.372
you had too much to drink to be operating

189
00:07:33.372 --> 00:07:34.989
a motor vehicle safely,

190
00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:37.194
and I'm going to be placing
you under arrest for OUI,

191
00:07:37.194 --> 00:07:39.075
so turn around and put your
hands behind your back.

192
00:07:39.075 --> 00:07:41.199
Violation of intoxication laws

193
00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.653
can lead to a fine.

194
00:07:42.653 --> 00:07:45.860
With increasing fines for
subsequent violations.

195
00:07:46.068 --> 00:07:48.051
Loss of driving privileges,

196
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.059
and even jail time.

197
00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:53.087
Being found guilty can do
more than ruin your day.

198
00:07:53.387 --> 00:07:56.116
You're likely to get
fired from your camp job.

199
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.765
You've damaged the reputation of the camp

200
00:07:58.765 --> 00:08:00.153
where you worked.

201
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.896
The record of your conviction

202
00:08:01.896 --> 00:08:03.715
can negatively affect your goals

203
00:08:03.715 --> 00:08:05.449
for future employment.

204
00:08:05.596 --> 00:08:07.761
Up to this point I've been talking about

205
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:11.932
laws of the state or province or country,

206
00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:15.231
but there maybe other laws
related to alcohol use

207
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:17.010
in your jurisdiction.

208
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:21.125
These laws impose financial
responsibility on you

209
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:22.855
for the injury to somebody else

210
00:08:22.855 --> 00:08:24.837
caused by your conduct.

211
00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:28.175
They are often called
liquor liability laws.

212
00:08:28.485 --> 00:08:30.584
You likely already know

213
00:08:30.832 --> 00:08:33.444
that if you injure someone
because you're intoxicated,

214
00:08:33.444 --> 00:08:36.108
you may be financially
liable for the damages

215
00:08:36.108 --> 00:08:37.989
or injury you've caused.

216
00:08:37.989 --> 00:08:39.280
For example,

217
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.937
if you hit or injure a person

218
00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.447
by operating your car while intoxicated,

219
00:08:43.447 --> 00:08:44.840
that person can sue you

220
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.615
and recover damages for
the injuries she suffered.

221
00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:49.465
In addition liquor liability law

222
00:08:49.465 --> 00:08:51.579
can impose financial
liability on you for merely

223
00:08:51.579 --> 00:08:54.516
giving someone else an alcoholic beverage.

224
00:08:54.516 --> 00:08:56.722
For example you give
alcohol to another person,

225
00:08:56.722 --> 00:08:59.943
say a fellow staff member
who is visibly intoxicated

226
00:08:59.943 --> 00:09:01.986
or is too young to legally drink.

227
00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:04.192
Later while she's operating her car,

228
00:09:04.192 --> 00:09:06.580
she causes a collision
because she's impaired

229
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.420
by the alcohol that you gave her.

230
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.098
In that collision

231
00:09:10.098 --> 00:09:12.770
she injures herself or somebody else.

232
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.382
You maybe financially
responsible for that injury.

233
00:09:16.382 --> 00:09:21.087
Or if you return to camp
intoxicated and injure a child

234
00:09:21.087 --> 00:09:24.194
or unable to assist a child in need,

235
00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:27.751
you may be financially
responsible for that injury.

236
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.711
This child for example is sick,

237
00:09:29.711 --> 00:09:31.359
but can't wake up.

238
00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:33.880
Her intoxicated cabin counselor.

239
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.904
So what's the bottom line here?

240
00:09:35.904 --> 00:09:39.004
First, know what the alcohol laws are

241
00:09:39.004 --> 00:09:40.699
where you will be working.

242
00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:43.499
Second, don't buy or
give alcoholic beverages

243
00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:46.615
to someone who is not old
enough to legally drink

244
00:09:46.823 --> 00:09:49.273
or who is visibly intoxicated.

245
00:09:49.273 --> 00:09:52.360
Third, if you are not of age,

246
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.819
don't ask someone who
is to get or give you

247
00:09:55.819 --> 00:09:57.737
alcoholic beverages.

248
00:09:58.012 --> 00:10:00.232
To do so is asking them to break the law

249
00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:03.979
and possibly be financially
liable for your acts.

250
00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:07.043
It's not something that
friend or colleague would do.

251
00:10:07.043 --> 00:10:09.046
Fourth, when you've been drinking

252
00:10:09.046 --> 00:10:11.884
the best course is to
appoint a designated driver,

253
00:10:11.884 --> 00:10:15.122
someone who has consumed no alcohol at all.

254
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:19.866
Fifth, stop consuming
alcohol at least eight hours

255
00:10:19.866 --> 00:10:23.006
before you are going back on duty in camp.

256
00:10:23.006 --> 00:10:25.253
Finally if you're ever intoxicated,

257
00:10:25.253 --> 00:10:28.393
impaired or even hungover in camp,

258
00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:30.883
have the courage to tell your supervisor

259
00:10:30.883 --> 00:10:32.946
and don't work until you're able.

260
00:10:32.946 --> 00:10:35.878
Yes, it's going to make your boss unhappy.

261
00:10:36.077 --> 00:10:38.400
But think about the alternative,

262
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.581
the child could be injured or killed

263
00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:44.128
because something you do or failed to do

264
00:10:44.128 --> 00:10:46.913
because you are impaired
by the use of alcohol.

265
00:10:47.243 --> 00:10:50.151
Better to be honest and
upfront about the mistake

266
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:52.092
than risk the alternative.

267
00:10:52.092 --> 00:10:53.273
So remember,

268
00:10:53.273 --> 00:10:56.251
you cannot do your duty
of care for children

269
00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:59.289
if you're intoxicated
by alcoholic beverages.

270
00:10:59.289 --> 00:11:02.897
This summer, cope with
stress in healthy ways.

271
00:11:02.897 --> 00:11:04.899
Spend your time off wisely,

272
00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:06.353
and support your colleagues

273
00:11:06.353 --> 00:11:08.554
in making smart decisions.

274
00:11:08.854 --> 00:11:10.714
Before I close I want to acknowledge

275
00:11:10.714 --> 00:11:12.798
the fine work of the
campers and counselors

276
00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:15.080
that helped me produce this module.

277
00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:17.087
Some of the acting showed conduct

278
00:11:17.087 --> 00:11:19.415
which was unsafe or inappropriate.

279
00:11:19.415 --> 00:11:21.620
Such conduct was just acting,

280
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.338
and does not accurately reflect

281
00:11:23.338 --> 00:11:25.337
their behavior in camp.

282
00:11:25.337 --> 00:11:27.720
That wraps up this leadership essential.

283
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.449
Thanks for watching and
have a great summer.

284
00:11:33.783 --> 00:11:36.856
